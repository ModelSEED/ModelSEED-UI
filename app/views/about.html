        <hr>
        <p>ModelSEED is a resource for the reconstruction, exploration,
        comparison, and analysis of metabolic models.</p>

            <p>The <b>ModelSEED</b> resource is based upon work supported by the
            U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Biological and Environmental Research; under contract DE-AC02-06CH11357

            <p>The <b>PlantSEED</b> resource was created with support by the National Science Foundation Grant IOS-1025398, by an endowment from the C. V. Griffin Sr. Foundation, and by the Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research, of the US Department of Energy (DOE) under Contract DE-ACO2-06CH11357, as part of the DOE Systems Biology Knowledgebase.</p>

            <p>The National Science Foundation Grant IOS-1444202 has provided support for both the improvement of the PlantSEED resource and the production of new modeling tools within ModelSEED to be able to annotate plant genomes using the PlantSEED platform and develop plant metabolism models. This grant also supports the implementation of four PlantSEED metabolic modeling workshops to train faculty, post-doctoral fellows and graduate students of American universities (with an emphasis on recruitment of faculty from minority serving institutions) in the use of these novel computational tools.</p>
