## Current Position
- **Milestone**: 2 (v1-beta)
- **Phase**: 21 (execution complete, verification partial)
- **Task**: PATRIC/RAST table integration implemented and build-verified
- **Status**: Waiting for authenticated browser validation

## Last Session Summary
Phase 21 implementation is complete at code/build level:
- Plan 21.1: added `lib/api/patric.ts` and `listRastGenomes` API support in `lib/api/modelseed.ts`.
- Plan 21.2: added `PatricGenomesTable` and `RastGenomesTable` with Build Model action wiring in `app/(build-model)/plant/page.tsx`.
- `npm run build` passes after integration.
- Debug follow-up fixed runtime API issues:
  - PATRIC query builder now falls back to `keyword(*)` for empty/invalid search input.
  - RAST RPC now retries with `list_rast_jobs` when `msSupport` package prefix is unsupported.
- Follow-up UI simplification:
  - Removed the Selected Genome Configuration blocks from PATRIC/RAST tabs; table row action is now the only build trigger.

## Next Steps
1. Authenticate in browser with a valid PATRIC/RAST token.
2. Verify PATRIC search and RAST job listing populate in `/plant` tabs.
3. Submit one reconstruction from each tab and confirm job tracking in `/my-models`.
